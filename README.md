# CIVENG794 Course Project — Traffic Flow Modeling & Simulation

## Code Structure for Tasks 1, 2, and 3

└── (data/)             # CSV dataset in this sub-directory: name format: 'trajectories-0500-0515.csv'

```

To run the code for the project:

```terminal
python run_all.py
```

To run the code for each part of the project, for example the stability analysis:
```terminal
python stability.py
```

Note: Make sure the files that are generated by the codes before are present before you run the code, i.e cf_best_params.csv is needed for **stability.py**.
